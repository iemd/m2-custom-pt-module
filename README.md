# The custom product types
- Each product has its specifics. For example, the **virtual** and **downloadable** products do not have the `weight` attribute.
- Therefore, they are **excluded** from the **standard shipping calculations**.
- With **custom coding** around **built-in product types**, by using **observers** and **plugins** we can achieve almost any functionality. However, this is not enough sometimes or there is no solution to the requirement.
- In cases such as these, we might need to create our **own product type** that will match the project requirements in a more streamlined way.
